Visualizing Bulgarian Solitaire states
(Bulgarian Solitaire)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_solitaire] is a simple 'game' where $N$ objects (usually cards) are placed into different piles, one is taken from each pile and made into a new pile, repeating.
The game has to converge to either a limit cycle or a stabilizing point.

This is a program that graphs out the game tree of the Bulgarian Solitaire game. Example visualizations for sizes $6$ through $15$ are in **fig**.
